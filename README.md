# QuantWork ðŸ“ˆ

## Overview

**QuantWork** is a Python project for financial modeling and market data analysis.

There are currently two major development streams:
1. **Market Data** â€” Fetch and analyze real market data (options, stock prices, interest rates) from Yahoo Finance (or local csv/excel files)
2. **Quant Library** â€” Build and implement quantitative models (in progress).

from MarketData.OptionDataFetcher import OptionDataFetcher

# Initialize with a ticker
apple_data = OptionDataFetcher("AAPL")

# Fetch market data and build the forward curve
apple_data.build_market()

# List available maturities
print(apple_data.get_maturities())

# Plot the forward curve
apple_data.plot_forward_curve()
```
