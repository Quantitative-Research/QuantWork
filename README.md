# QuantWork

**QuantWork** is a Python-based project that focuses on financial data analysis and quantitative modeling. The project is divided into two primary streams:

### 1) **Market Data Analysis from Yahoo Finance**
This part of the project involves retrieving and analyzing real-time market data from Yahoo Finance. The goal is to fetch data such as stock prices, options data, implied volatilities, and other key market indicators. 

- **Key Features**:
  - Fetch real-time market data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
  - Extract and analyze stock options data (calls, puts, strikes, implied volatility).
  - Estimate forward curves and interest rate curves based on market data.
  - Visualization tools for market data analysis, including volatility smiles and forward curve plots, risk neutral probability densities.

### 2) **Quantitative Library and Financial Models**
The second stream is focused on building a quantitative library with financial models. This includes implementing various models used in finance for pricing, risk analysis, and optimization.

- **Key Features**:
  - Implementation of common financial models (e.g., Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo simulation, option pricing models).
 
  To get relevant results from the second stream, we must first focus on the first stream :)
